2)WRITE A BLOG ON DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
    
    1)HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.
    2)HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection,
While HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
    3)HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense 
that if there is less network delay,then the page loads faster.


3)WRITE  A BLOG ABOUT OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT.

    In Javascript, an object is a standalone entity,with properties and type.
Compare it with a cup, for example.A cup is an object, with properties. A cup
has a color , a design, weight, a material it is made of,etc. The same way,
Javascript objects can have properties , which define their characteristics.
 CREATING OBJECTS IN JAVASCRIPT:
1)By object literal.
2)By creating instance of object directly(using new keyword).
